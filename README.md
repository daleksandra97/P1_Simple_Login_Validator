# P1_Simple_Login_Validator

## Description
This is a simple login logic simulation using basic Python conditionals. 
I focused on getting the logic flow right — like checking Terms of Service first, then credentials, then account status. It helped me understand how to prioritize checks and write clean conditional logic

## What does it do?

The program checks the following conditions in order:

1. Whether the user has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS)
2. Whether the entered username and password are correct
3. Whether the account is locked

It prints a message based on which condition fails (or succeeds).

## Purpose

The goal of this project was to practice:

- Writing and structuring `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Using logical operators like `not`, `or`, and `!=`
- Thinking about **logic flow** and **basic security concepts** like information hiding

## Things I Learned

- How to use Python conditionals to control program flow
- How to order login checks to avoid leaking sensitive account information
- How to write clean, readable code using only the basics

## How to Run

You can run the script using any Python interpreter (version 3.x).
